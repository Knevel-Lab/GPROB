Description: Many diseases may have similar presentations in the clinic. By
  using genetic information, it may sometimes be possible to prioritize some
  diagnoses over others. GPROB implements calculations of genetic probability
  from genotypes and effect sizes for genetic variants associated with
  diseases.
